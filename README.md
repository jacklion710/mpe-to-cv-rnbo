# MPE to Control Voltage RNBO Patch

Max RNBO patch designed for converting digital MIDI controller signals to control voltage for controlling analog synths

Note: This project is currently a work in progress.

I am currently working on an extension for the raspberry pi 3 model B to attach DC coupled outputs. Will post instructions and schematics when available.

Stay tuned for updates.
